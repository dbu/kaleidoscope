A set of sketches for [processing.org](http://processing.org/) to do colorful kaleidoscope images.

* kaleidoscope_image: kaleidoscope with images. see the doc comment in kaleidoscope_image.pde for the available commands to control the look
* kaleidoscope_applet: the image kaleidoscope with smaller size and ready to build an applet
* kaleidoscope_camera: instead of an image, use the input of a webcam captured with gsvideo

# Credits

* The default pattern for the image kaleidoscope comes from a [painting by my mother, Catherine Buchmann](http://www.catherinebuchmann.ch/bilder/main.php)
* This project would have taken a lot more time (or rather, I would never have done it) without the cool [processing.org](http://processing.org/) framework.
* I got the initial inspiration from this [article from Matt Booth](http://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/create-unique-kaleidoscope-graphics) - although the result does not resemble his article much.
